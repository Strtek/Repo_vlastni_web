This web application is written using the Django framework in Python. It has a public section with basic information and subsequently a private section for logged-in users only. Users can register and registered users can then log in. Once logged in, users can leave messages. Each user sees only their own messages. They can filter them by the date they were posted. The administrator can see messages from all users and can filter messages by user, date posted, or both criteria.
